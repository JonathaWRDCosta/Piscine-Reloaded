# Piscine Reloaded

Welcome to **Piscine Reloaded**! This project is a collection of exercises aimed at reinforcing your understanding of C programming basics. Each exercise will help you revisit key concepts such as functions, loops, pointers, and structures.

## Project Overview

The Piscine Reloaded revisits many exercises from the C Piscine, and challenges you to complete them from scratch. The main goal is to practice and reinforce concepts without reusing past code, allowing you to develop a deep understanding through repetition and refinement.

## General Rules

- All exercises must be executed according to the turn-in procedures.
- Your solutions will be checked by **Moulinette**, an automated evaluation tool. Ensure your work passes the **norminette** check.
- Only use allowed functions, and follow the strict submission format for each exercise.

This should cover all exercises. Let me know if you need further adjustments or help!

## Submission and Peer-Evaluation

- All exercises must be submitted through your Git repository.
- Ensure file and folder names are accurate, as only the content inside your repository will be evaluated during the defense.
- Double-check your work against the submission requirements to avoid any errors.

Happy coding, and good luck with the exercises!
